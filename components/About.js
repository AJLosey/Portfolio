                <p>I highly recommend that everyone listen to the 2016 album "Spirit Phone"
                    by Lemon Demon. There's a song called "Cabinet Man" about a living arcade machine that has two lines
                    that reference the game "Polybius". For those that don't know, Polybius is an equally fictional
                    arcade
                    machine allegedly deployed by some deep-government-psy-ops that drove people crazy. "Lemon Demon,"
                    by
                    the
                    way, is a band with only one official member, the musical genius called Neil Cicierega. Another one
                    of
                    my favorite songs in the album is "Spiral of Ants". This masterpiece describes a real phenomenon
                    where
                    ants accidentally lay down guiding pheremones in a circle. Ants can get trapped in this circle,
                    following their own trails, and laying down more pheremones as they go. Other ants get sucked in,
                    the problem worsens, and eventually massive swarms can get caught up in this lethal feedback loop.
                    It's
                    insane, fascinating, and the song makes me think of the future of our own species. <br></br> As for more official information about myself, I am a student in the
                    full-stack development bootcamp at
                    University of Texas. I
                    live in the South Austin
                    area. I enjoy javascript and c#, and have some familiarity with html, css, jquery, and bootstrap.
                    When
                    I'm not learning code, I'm either learning something about biology, learning about or playing video
                    games, writing, or I'm asleep. </p>

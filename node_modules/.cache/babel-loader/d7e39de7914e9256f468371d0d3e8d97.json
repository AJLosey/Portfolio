Another one of my favorite songs in the album is \\\"Spiral of Ants\\\". This masterpiece describes a real phenomenon where ants accidentally lay down guiding pheremones in a circle. Ants can get trapped in this circle, following their own trails, and laying down more pheremones as they go. Other ants get sucked in, the problem worsens, and eventually massive swarms can get caught up in this lethal feedback loop.

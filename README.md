# Advanced-css-homework

Description:
This is an assignment where we are supposed to match a website. Target website can be found at ./images/finished-example.png. I have a Navbar, a banner, and then three sections of content, for information about me, placeholders for where links to future projects will go, and for contacting me, in that order.
